## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vincent Epler

I am a detail-oriented and analytical BS Mathematics graduate from Benguet State University, with a strong foundation in quantitative methods and specialized training in data analysis and advanced Microsoft Excel. This repository showcases my projects, demonstrating my ability to apply mathematical concepts and technical skills to transform complex datasets into actionable insights.

## Projects

Here you'll find a selection of my work, including academic research and projects that highlight my analytical capabilities:

* **Thesis: Mathematical Modeling of Rice Blast Disease:** Developed and simulated a compartmental ODE model (SLIP model) to study the effect of fungicide and roguing in reducing crop infection in CAR provinces using Python and MATLAB 
* **Research Project: Shortest Path Analysis for Dialysis Center Placement in Natonin, Mountain Province:** Applied Dijkstra's algorithm in Microsoft Excel to determine the optimal location of dialysis centers for remote areas in Mountain Province 
* **Thesis: Mathematical Modeling of Rice Blast Disease:** Developed and simulated a compartmental ODE model (SLIP model) to study the effect of fungicide and roguing in reducing crop infection in CAR provinces using Python and MATLAB
* **Research Project: Shortest Path Analysis for Dialysis Center Placement in Natonin, Mountain Province:** Applied Dijkstra's algorithm in Microsoft Excel to determine the optimal location of dialysis centers for remote areas in Mountain Province 
* **Spreadsheet Projects** Created dashboards and Analaysis on datasets from open repositories and projects, showcasing skill in data analysis and presentation
* **Python Capstone Projects** Created data analysis and visualizations in python from open repositories and projects, showcasing my familiarization with python and its libraries used in analytics
